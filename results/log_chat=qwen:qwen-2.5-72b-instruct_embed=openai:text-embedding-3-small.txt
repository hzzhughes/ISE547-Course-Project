Detected choice: B Expected: B
[DEBUG] Trying model.invoke(messages)...
Q q2: Which monster type can be used as Synchro Material for a Synchro Summon?
Model output:
 C: Only Tuner monsters plus one or more non-Tuner monsters

Justification: According to the rulebook, a Synchro Summon requires 1 face-up Tuner monster and any number of other face-up non-Tuner monsters, where the combined Levels of these monsters must equal the Level of the Synchro Monster you want to Synchro Summon.

Q q6: Which of the following best describes a 'Chain' in Yu-Gi-Oh!?
Model output:
 C: A stack of Spell/Trap/Monster effects that resolve last-in, first-out

Justification: According to the rulebook, a Chain is a way to order the resolution of multiple card effects.

Q q7: What is required to perform a Ritual Summon?
Model output:
 B: A Ritual Spell Card and tributing monsters whose Levels equal or exceed the Ritual Monster's Level

Justification: According to the rulebook, to perform a Ritual Summon, you need a Ritual Spell Card and the required Tribute, which is listed on the Ritual Spell Card. The Tribute involves sending monsters from your hand or the field to the Graveyard, and their Levels must equal or exceed the Level of the Ritual Monster you are trying to summon.

Q q11: What is the maximum number of cards allowed in a Main Deck in official Yu-Gi-Oh! tournaments?
Model output:
 A: 40 cards

However, the implication is that you should not exceed 40 cards because having more makes it harder to draw your best cards when needed. In official tournaments, the standard is to have exactly 40 cards in your Main Deck.

Model output:
 
Detected choice: None Expected: D
[DEBUG] Trying model.invoke(messages)...
[DEBUG] Trying model.generate([[messages]])...
Q q20: What is the difference between 'destroy' and 'send to the Graveyard'?
Model output:
 D: 'Destroy' is a specific game action that can trigger certain effects; 'send to GY' does not count as destruction

Justification: According to the rulebook, a card is considered "destroyed" when it is sent to the Graveyard due to battle between monsters or by an effect that destroys a card. However, a card that is sent to the Graveyard as a cost, Tribute, or by other means is not considered "destroyed." Therefore, 'destroy' and 'send to the Graveyard' are distinct actions, with 'destroy' being a specific type of action that can activate certain effects.
