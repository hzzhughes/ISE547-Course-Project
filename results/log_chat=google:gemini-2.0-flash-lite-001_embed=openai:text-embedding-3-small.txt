Q q1: What is a Link Monster primarily used for in Yu-Gi-Oh!?
Model output:
 B: The rulebook states that Link Monsters open up more zones for Extra Deck summons, utilizing red Link Arrows as "Link Markers."

Detected choice: B Expected: B
[DEBUG] Trying model.invoke(messages)...
Q q2: Which monster type can be used as Synchro Material for a Synchro Summon?
Model output:
 C. Based on the provided rulebook content, you need 1 face-up "Tuner" monster and any number of face-up non-Tuner monsters.

Detected choice: C Expected: C
[DEBUG] Trying model.invoke(messages)...
Q q3: If a card text reads 'You can only use this effect of "Card Name" once per turn', what does that mean?
Model output:
 D. The text "You can only use this effect of "Card Name" once per turn" restricts the use of that specific effect to once during your turn. Even if you control multiple copies of the card, you can only activate the effect once.

Detected choice: D Expected: D
[DEBUG] Trying model.invoke(messages)...
Q q4: Which of the following is TRUE about 'Link Arrows' on Link Monsters?
Model output:
 C: Link Arrows point to zones and can enable summoning Extra Deck monsters to those zones. The rulebook states: "every Main Monster Zone that a Link Monster points to can also be used to Summon monsters from your Extra Deck."

Detected choice: C Expected: C
[DEBUG] Trying model.invoke(messages)...
Q q5: What happens when a monster that was Special Summoned from the Extra Deck is sent to the GY?
Model output:
 B: It is sent to the GY like any other monster, but some effects may banish it instead. The rulebook states that unless otherwise specified, a special summoned monster is placed on the field in your choice of face-up Attack Position or face-up Defense Position. It does not mention any special handling when such a monster goes to the GY. Some effects like Samsara would change the destination.

Detected choice: B Expected: B
[DEBUG] Trying model.invoke(messages)...
Q q6: Which of the following best describes a 'Chain' in Yu-Gi-Oh!?
Model output:
 C: A chain is described in the text as multiple card effects activating at once, or when a player wants to use an effect after a card has been played, but BEFORE that card has an effect on the game. The effects are stacked and resolved in reverse order.

[DEBUG] Trying model.invoke(messages)...
Q q7: What is required to perform a Ritual Summon?

Q q8: Which card effect type can respond to another effect to negate it in the Chain?
Model output:
 D is the correct answer. The rulebook explains that chains are made by both players adding effects, and cards can be chained to other cards' effects. The example uses "Seven Tools of the Bandit," which is a counter trap (a type of card that can negate) to negate the effect of "Threatening Roar." The question asks what kind of card effect type can respond to another to negate it, which aligns with quick-play spells, traps that have negate effects, or monster effects that can negate.

Detected choice: D Expected: D
[DEBUG] Trying model.invoke(messages)...

Detected choice: A Expected: C
[DEBUG] Trying model.invoke(messages)...

Q q18: What does 'banish' mean in Yu-Gi-Oh!?

[DEBUG] Trying model.invoke(messages)...
